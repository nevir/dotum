Dotum is MIT licensed.  [See the accompanying file](MIT-LICENSE.md) for the
full text.

Dotum [also includes](extern/json/CHANGES.md) the pure-Ruby portions of
[flori's JSON implementation](https://github.com/flori/json), which is
[Ruby licensed](extern/json/COPYING).  This is used for Ruby implementations
that do not already bundle it (i.e. 1.8), so that Dotum doesn't have to depend
on other gems.
